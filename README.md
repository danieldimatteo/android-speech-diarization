# android-speech-diarization
*** NO LONGER UNDER DEVELOPMENT ***

Supervised by Professor Jonathan Rose (University of Toronto), the development
of this Android application was the subject of an undergraduate thesis in 
electrical and computer engineering. Essentially, the app 'listens' to a 
conversation between N speakers (where N is unknown), and calculates the 
percentage of time spent each speaker takes up in the conversation. This type 
of audio signal processing is referred to as "Speech Diarization", and 
historically has been used to answer the question "who spoke when" in a 
conversation.

NOTE: This project is now longer under development, but it's here for anyone 
interested. If you try to run the project on a device, you will eventually hit
an error related to a missing 'config.xml' file. Place it into the root 
of the external storage directory of your device to actually run this project
